Hello,
This project has developed by SavasKalkan for MDRN

Message from developer;

Firstly, I tried to keep the project easy,
I used some packages inside the project like redux, navigation, etc.
I could not add commands sorry for it because of I had not time much,
On the other hand, the project is easy to understand and I tried to write codes clearly and to keep them readable.

What could I add in addition to this project?
Test,
Typescript.

If you have any questions please notify me.
